HOW THE AUDIO SHOULD PLAY!

WIND AMBIENCE:
	all of the wind sounds should always be looping
	amb_wind_calm should always be at 100% volume
	Keep amb_wind_blowy and amb_wind_veryblowy at 0% vol until you want the wind to be blowing, then just increase them as needed
	that's all!

WAVES AMBIENCE:
	amb_waves_loop should always be looping. The volume could be lowered by ~25% when we're on an island
